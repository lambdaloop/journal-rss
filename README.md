# journal-rss

A FastAPI web server for creating RSS feeds for scholarly journals with the magic of adversarial interoperability

Many journals still have RSS feeds. Some don't though, as they try
and squeeze everyone onto their platforms to monetize our 
engagement data.

This is a simple web app for creating RSS feeds for journals by
collecting metadata from crossref. Dependencies are kept minimal, as
is deployment - No webpack, no complex build, no postgres,
just pip install and press play :).
